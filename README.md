# Frameworks & Intro to JS Knowledge Check | Bootstrap Basics

# Description
This assignment is a fully responsive registration webpage built using Bootstrap basics, utilities, forms, and components. This assignment was meant to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap's layout system, components, utilities, forms, and responsive features.

## Features

-   **Responsive Navigation Bar** – Collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. 
    
-   **Registration Form** – Includes inputs for first name, last name, email, and password. Checkbox for agreeing to terms and conditions. Uses Bootstrap's validation classes.
    
-   **Responsive Table** – Displays hard-coded sample user data. Styled with Bootstrap’s table, table-striped, table-hover, and table-bordered classes as well as wrapped in a table-responsive container for mobile support.
    
-   **Image Section** – Full-width responsive image using (img-fluid). Circular profile image using (rounded-circle).
    
-   **Buttons with Display Utilities** – One button is always visible. Second button is hidden on small screens using (d-none d-md-inline-block).
    
-   **Responsiveness** – This page is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes using: bootstrap's grid system (row, col-md-6), utility classes (w-100, mt-5, text-center, etc.) Responsive display classes (d-none, d-md-block) and responsive image support with (img-fluid)
 

## Notes

I used Bootstrap 5 throughout this assignment to create a clean and responsive layout. The form includes required fields with validation feedback, and I added a hard-coded table to simulate user submissions. I worked with Bootstrap’s grid system to place form fields side by side and used utility classes to control spacing, alignment, and visibility. The image section helped me practice using responsive images and styling one as a circular profile picture. I also included two buttons to demonstrate how display utilities work. One is always visible, and the other hides on smaller screens. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how Bootstrap components and utilities work together to build mobile-friendly web pages.
